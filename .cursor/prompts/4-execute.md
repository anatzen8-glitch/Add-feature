# Execute (Step 4)

Implement precisely as planned, in full.

**Important:** The user must reference the plan file (e.g. `@PLAN-feature-name.md` or paste its path) so you know which plan to execute. If no plan is in context, ask for it.

Implementation Requirements:

- Write elegant, minimal, modular code.
- Adhere strictly to existing code patterns, conventions, and best practices.
- Include thorough, clear comments/documentation within the code.
- As you implement each step:
  - Update the plan markdown file with emoji status (🟩🟨🟥) and overall progress percentage.
